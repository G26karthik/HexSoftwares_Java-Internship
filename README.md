Hi,
This is my code repo for the projects i have done while doing intership at hex software .
My First Project is Student Grade Calculater




--> In this project i have 

*Created a Student class with attributes like name, student ID, and an array of grades.


*Implemented methods to calculate the average grade, display individual grades and determine if the student has passed or failed.


*Included functionality to input multiple students and calculate the class average.
